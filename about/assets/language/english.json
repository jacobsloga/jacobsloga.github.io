This is used as a metaphor for socio-economic development i.e. the more money you have the easier it is to make money.", "As a consequence of this correlation, escaping poverty is a lot harder than the money needed to escape poverty suggests. If you earn $2 per day or less (like 11% of the global population did in 2017) then an extra $2 would double your daily earnings. If, however, you were earning over $8 per day (like 11% of the global population in 2017) then that same extra $2 does not make much difference to you, at least not in terms of your quality of life.", "Through this site I hope to shed light on this topic in more detail through the power of data visualisation. Some of the visualisations will be directly relateable to socio-economic development, other will have a loose connection. I hope that all will be of interest to someone."]
